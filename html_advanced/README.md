## Web Front-End Development

### Overview

Front-end web development focuses on building the user interface and experience of a website or web application. It involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing, interactive, and responsive web pages that function across different devices and browsers.

### Key Technologies

#### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

- Defines the structure and content of a webpage.
- Uses elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` for a semantic structure.

#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- Controls the appearance of web pages (colors, layout, typography).
- Includes modern techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and CSS animations.

#### JavaScript (JS)

- Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- Works with the DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate content in real-time.

#### Front-End Frameworks & Libraries

- CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
- JS Libraries & Frameworks: React.js, Vue.js, Angular

### Version Control & Deployment

- Git & GitHub for managing code changes and collaboration.
- Hosting & Deployment: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages.

### Fundamental Concepts

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring web pages work on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
